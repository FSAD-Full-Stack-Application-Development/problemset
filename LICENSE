Greetings, intrepid code explorer. Congratulations on finding my project. Before you start copying, pasting, or claiming this as your own brilliant masterpiece, please read this carefully. I promise it’s worth it.

**1. Permissions — For the Good Humans**
You are hereby granted permission to:
  - Read the code. Seriously, you can just look at it. Knowledge is power.
  - Tinker, experiment, and break things in your own personal sandbox.
  - Fork, clone, or remix this project **for learning, inspiration, or fun**.
  - Reference it in a blog, tutorial, or presentation (credit would be nice, humans appreciate that).

**2. Forbidden Activities — For the Lazy, Greedy, or Desperate**
You may **not**:
  - Copy this code and submit it as your own assignment, lab work, or any other graded activity. If you do, you will not only anger the grading gods but also risk the wrath of anyone who can tell plagiarism when they see it.
  - Claim you wrote this. If you do, a small puppy somewhere will be mildly disappointed.
  - Use this code to cheat, mislead, or otherwise pretend that you understand things better than you do. We both know you don’t.
  - Blame me if your professor, TA, or AI grader notices you didn’t actually write anything. That is on YOU.

**3. Legalese (a.k.a “I have to protect myself”)**
The Software is provided **“as-is”**, with absolutely no guarantees, warranties, or promises that it works, is correct, or won’t crash in spectacular and hilarious ways. 
  - If your Docker breaks.
  - If PostgreSQL decides to have an existential crisis.
  - If your Rails server spontaneously combusts (figuratively, hopefully not literally).
I am not responsible. Seriously. Not responsible at all.  

**4. Academic Usage**
Feel free to use this software for:
  - Learning SQL, Rails, or any other tech mentioned here.
  - Experimenting with web app design, MVC, cookies, or databases.
  - Proving to yourself that you can actually understand code that is someone else’s.  

Do **not**:
  - Submit it for points without doing actual work.
  - Attempt to fool anyone into thinking this is your original effort.
  - Even think about it twice. Just don’t.

**5. Sharing**
You may share this project with friends, colleagues, or random internet strangers, provided:
  - You include this very license, so they also know they are not allowed to be evil.
  - You don’t misrepresent it as your own work. Copying is easy; integrity is harder.

**6. Credits**
All sarcasm, wittiness, and occasional cleverness belongs to the original author, Saugat Shakya. Any resemblance to other human beings attempting to be funny is purely coincidental.

**7. Moral of the Story**
If you respect this license:
  - You will learn more.
  - You might impress someone.
  - You won’t get yelled at by professors.
  
If you violate this license:
  - Karma will notice.
  - Your integrity may take a vacation.
  - And yes… there may be puppies disappointed.

By reading this, you agree to follow it, laugh a little, and not be that person who copies assignments without actually learning anything.

Enjoy responsibly. 😎
